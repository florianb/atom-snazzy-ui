# atom-snazzy-ui theme

> An elegant _not so bright_ snazzy-ui-theme for Atom -- based on https://github.com/sindresorhus/iterm2-snazzy and as supplement of https://atom.io/themes/atom-snazzy-syntax

This theme aims for

- visually fitting into the [snazzy-terminal-themes](https://github.com/sindresorhus?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=snazzy&type=&language=)
- being less bright & therefore more relaxing, like atom-snazzy-syntax

## This theme is a living work in progress

Since i don't have any experience in creating themes for Atom i think i missed a lot of impovements. However - if you feel you'd like to change anything propose a PR or open an Issue. :heart:
